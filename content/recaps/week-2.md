## Trivia
- Supersymmetric string theory— an attempt to explain all of the particles and fundamental forces of nature in one theory by modeling them as vibrations of tiny supersymmetric strings
- Loop quantum gravity theory— aims to merge quantum mechanics and general relativity in an attempt to develop quantum theory of gravity. Space and time composed of finite loops woven into a network

The solar system has many theories on its formation. Two of the most prevalant are: 
  - Tidal Theory / Chamberlain-Moulton Theory— passing star pulled dust and debris from the forming sun; the pulled debris formed the planets
  - Nebular hypothesis— formed by the gravitational collapse of a giant molecular cloud spanning several light-years
The nebular hypothesis is the most widely accepted theory
